Ajax add to cart for WooCommerce products

== Description ==
[About Us](https://quadlayers.com/) | [Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/quadlayers/) | [Github](https://github.com/franmastromarino/woo-ajax-add-to-cart)

The default add to cart button of WooCommerce reloads the entire site each time a product is added to the cart. The more steps and time your e-commerce load, the more you reduce the chances of selling.

Ajax add to cart for WooCommerce allows users to include single products or variable products in the cart without the need to reload the entire site each time.
